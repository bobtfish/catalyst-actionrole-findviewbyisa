NAME
    Catalyst::ActionRole::FindViewByIsa - Select from the available
    application views by type

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Controller::Foo;
        use Moose;

        BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole'; }

        sub foo : Local Does('FindViewByIsa') FindViewByIsa('Catalyst::View::TT') {
            # Code here. If $c->stash->{current_view} is set, it will be left alone
            #            after this method is run. Otherwise it will be set to
            #            the first app view which @ISA Catalyst::View::TT
        }

DESCRIPTION
    If you are trying to write a generic controller component which will be
    reused within an application, you do not want to mandate the use of one
    type of view, but if you're providing templates with your component,
    then you need to be able to find a view of the appropriate type.

    Therefore this action role will select a the view in the application
    which matches the class of view that you want, no matter what it is
    named locally within the application.
